# Scania Banner Plugin

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Shell script

Run `pushlish.sh` shell script with destination file pointed to consolidate the angular production generated files to one single javascript file -- so that it can be later imported into any frontend as an external plugin.
